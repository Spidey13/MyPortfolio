## General Guidelines

### Image Specifications:
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or 4:3 for project cards
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080px
- **Format**: WebP or PNG for best quality
- **File Size**: Optimize to <200KB per image

### Where to Source Images:
1. **Create Custom**: Use Figma, Sketch, or Illustrator for diagrams
2. **Screenshot**: Actual dashboard/UI screenshots (best authenticity)
3. **Generate**: Use AI tools (Midjourney, DALL-E) with specific prompts
4. **Mockup Tools**: Placeit, Smartmockups for device mockups

### Placeholder Options (Current):
- Gradient backgrounds (current implementation)
- Abstract patterns using SVG
- Iconography (Material Symbols)
- Color blocks with tech-themed textures

---

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Most Visible):
1. **F1 Race Strategy Simulator** - Most relatable/visual project
2. **AI Research Assistant** - Complex, impressive architecture
3. **Audio-Lyric Alignment** - Unique, creative project

### Medium Priority:
4. **Smart Chatbot with Memory** - Good UI potential
5. **Healthcare QA System** - Professional, academic appeal

### Lower Priority (Can use placeholders):
6. **Semiconductor Defect Detection**
7. **Wafer Fault Detection** (similar to #6)
8. **AI Portfolio** (can use actual portfolio screenshot)

---

## Quick Wins

### Option 1: AI-Generated Images
Use specific prompts for each project:
```
"Technical diagram of multi-agent AI system with glowing nodes and connections, 
dark background, futuristic, clean, professional, 16:9 aspect ratio"
```

### Option 2: Screenshot Real Dashboards
If you have working versions, screenshot:
- MLflow dashboards
- Streamlit interfaces
- Any live demos

### Option 3: Enhanced Placeholders
Current gradient placeholders but with:
- Project-specific iconography
- Tech stack logos overlaid
- Subtle patterns/textures

---

**Recommendation**: Start with Option 3 (enhanced placeholders) for quick deployment, then gradually replace with Option 1 (AI-generated) or Option 2 (real screenshots) as you create them.
